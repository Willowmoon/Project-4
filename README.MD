## Description:
    After discussing my grandfather one day I realized that the only thing I couldn't remember was his voice. Since then it's been a passion of mine to create an application I wish I would have had. An application that would make it possible for people to answer, send and share those answers to loved ones to keep. 
    
    The best example I could come up with would be that if I had a video clip of a loved one talking about how they got through a rough situation, that would definitely help me out when I have those rough times.
